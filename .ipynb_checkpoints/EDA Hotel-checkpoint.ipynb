    "Several sites allow you to post a comment or opinion about a product, place, or event. Think of Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, or Reddit. However, on not all of these sites, you can see at a glance how many of these comments are written with a positive or negative mindset. \n",
    "\n",
    "For many people or companies, it is useful to know what percentage of the reactions are positive or negative. You can't always tell this by looking at a Like system. The main question you should be able to answer with the help of this project is; Is a piece of text positive or negative?\n",
